Synopsis: Compositional pipelines
Description:
  \"Iteratees done right\".  This library implements
  iteratees\/enumerators\/enumeratees simply and elegantly, using different
  naming conventions.
  .
  Advantages over traditional iteratee implementations:
  .
  * /Simpler semantics/: There is only one data type ('Pipe'), two primitives
    ('await' and 'yield'), and only one way to compose 'Pipe's ('.').  In fact,
    this library implements its entire behavior using its 'Monad' and 'Category'
    instances and enforces their laws strictly!
  .
  * /Clearer naming conventions/: Enumeratees are called 'Pipe's, Enumerators
    are 'Producer's, and Iteratees are 'Consumer's.  'Producer's and 'Consumer's
    are just type synonyms for 'Pipe's with either the input or output end
    closed.
  .
  * /Pipes are Categories/: You compose them using ordinary composition.
  .
  * /Intuitive/: Pipe composition is easier to reason about because it is a true
    'Category'.  Composition works seamlessly and you don't have to worry about
    restarting iteratees, feeding new input, etc.  \"It just works\".
  .
  * /"Vertical" concatenation works flawlessly on everything/: ('>>')
    concatenates 'Pipe's, but since everything is a 'Pipe', you can use it to
    concatenate 'Producer's, 'Consumer's, and even intermediate 'Pipe' stages.
    Vertical Concatenation always works the way you expect, picking up where the
    previous 'Pipe' left off.
  .
  * /Bidirectionality/: The library now provides a bidirectional 'Pipe' type,
    called a 'Proxy'.
  .
  Check out "Control.Pipe.Tutorial" for a copious introductory tutorial and
  "Control.Pipe" for the actual implementation.  "Control.Proxy.Tutorial"
  introduces bidirectional iteratees that are backwards-compatible with 'Pipe's
  and "Control.Proxy" provides the implementation.
